        "- ✅ Python + pytest test runner already configured\n"
        "- ✅ `tests/` package ready to grow (with sub-folders for pages, data and utils)\n"
        "- ✅ A first passing test (`tests/test_sample.py`) so you can check that everything works\n"
        "- ✅ Basic **GitHub Actions CI** workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) to run tests on every push\n"
